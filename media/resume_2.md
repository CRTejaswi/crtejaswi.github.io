Summary
---------

An Electronics & Communication (EC) graduate with a demonstrated exposure in Embedded Systems, Image Processing, and Python-based development; I am currently looking for an opportunity in similar domains. <br>
I have worked extensively with - AVR/ARM microcontrollers, implementing source codes in ASM/C; OCR & QR Codes in addition to conventional image processing; Python3 for creating GUIs & shell utilities, web applications (using Flask/Selenium), and machine learning scripts (using SciPy stack). <br>
I'm open to all software development roles. <br>
