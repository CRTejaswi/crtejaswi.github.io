I have always been afraid of offering technical advice, fearing my lack of technical expertise will land me in hot waters. But, there's always that lagging feeling that I know something of value, and I've always tried to get it across, alas, to no avail. I've realized that there's a couple of reasons I cannot be a truly thorough techie. One, being pragmatic, I choose to focus on useful aspects of anything, and discard everything that's of little use than fill up pages of a book or complete a theory. Two, I have a poor memory for things I don't put to use, or at least, not talk about.

This blog is an attempt to let myself out so I can maintain a sense of consistency about the stuff that I know.

More than anything, I've realized the nature of professionalism. Once you know something, there's only one way to know it, and that is to better yourself. To discover more by yourself, and constantly keep improving. That's the nature of colonization. You cannot stop and rest on your laurels in hopes that things will stay the same, forever.
