# Vim: Plugins

## PlugIn Manager
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

## [Git Wrapper]()

[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is a neat Git-client wrapper.

```
:G status
:G diff
:G commit
:G push
:G mergetool
:G difftool

```
You can also use [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) to indicate lines added/deleted/changed in your code.

## [Comments]

[vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) is a neat plugin to comment stuff is almost any language. Use `gc` operator to comment/uncomment stuff.
```
gcc  - comment current-line
gcap - comment a paragraph
gci{ - comment stuff inside {}
gcgc - toggle (comment, then uncomment)
```
Creating comment-strings for new filetypes is easy. For example, this associates the commentstring `#` for PowerShell file-types:
```
autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.ps1,*.psm1,*.psd1 set filetype=powershell syntax=powershell commentstring=#\ %s
```

__TODO__

- While `gc` works with codefiles, it doesn't work well with code within markdown files, as it simply comments it html-style. How to use "language" to trigger comment-string within codeblock?

## Interactive Scratchpad

A scratchpad allows you to look at possible outputs/errors while you're typing. This allows you to quickly test/modify your code as you're typing. This is most useful when studying data structures, as it allows you to test sections of your code with particular outputs.

[codi-vim](https://github.com/metakirby5/codi.vim) is a neat scratchpad plugin that supports multiple languages.
