# Vim: Structuring Web Projects

Emmet is the goto utility for autocompleting segments encountered with HTML/CSS/JS. A plugin is available for Vim as well, and can be installed using `Plug 'mattn/emmet-vim'`. The official cheatsheet is extensive; it covers a wide variety of use-cases.

Set leader-key to ',' so that `,,` becomes the goto cmd for autocompletion.
```
let g:user_emmet_mode='n'
let g:user_emmet_leader_key=','
```
That's all I have for now. I'll update things later.
