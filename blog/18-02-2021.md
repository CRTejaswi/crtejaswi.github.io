# File/Folder Navigation
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=fzf+file+navigation

The simplest way to navigate to a folder is using the `cd` (or the `Set-Location` cmdlet). You can use the `pushd/popd` cmdlets to switch back/forth from a folder, by pushing it's location onto stack, and then popping it. You can also use `~` to refer to the home location for your user profile (`C:\Users\USERNAME`), and can use relative-addressing to navigate. You can verify that this indeed refers to your user-profile by using tab-completion.
```powershell
cd folder
cd ..\..\folder
cd (ls file).Directory

pushd (ls file).Directory
popd

pushd ~/Videos
pushd 'C:\Users\Chaitanya Tejaswi\Videos\'
```
