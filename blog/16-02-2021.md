# PS: Login Cmdlet

This is one of the first cmdlets that I wrote for personal use.

If you're me, then you're probably skeptic of being blasted by ads based off of that wristwatch that you purchased as a gift. Consequently, you turn to anonymous browsing, or, in case you also like living under a rock (like me), you choose to log in/out of your social media accounts everytime.

Regardless of whether you choose to keep logged in or not, having a utility that lets you quickly log in/out of your accounts without your risking password leaks or bearing the burden of remembering each password. Also, having such a utility allows you to set as difficult a password as you like, and is useful for tasks such as paying your electricity bills, or your credit-card bills. Unlike [Jim Sarbh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Sarbh), I'm not a fan of paying my bills.

```powershell
function Get-Login{
    [cmdletBinding()]
    [Alias('glog')]
    param(
        [string]$Site,
        [switch]$List,
        [switch]$PassThru
    )
    $logins = Import-Csv $myLogins
    if ($List) {$logins.site}
    $match = $logins | where site -eq $Site
    if (-not $PassThru -and -not $List) {firefox $match.link}
    $match.username,$match.password | scb
}
```
```
